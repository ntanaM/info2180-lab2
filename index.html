        <p>One thing that really gets to me sometimes is how little time I have to draw during school. Where I used to make nearly 20 sketches a day, maybe even 2 full pieces a week, now I'm lucky if I even draw once a month. I just wish I had more time, but such is the life of a Com Sci student.</p>
        <p>I miss the flow of creativity that used to come so easily, the way I could lose myself in my art for hours on end. It’s frustrating to juggle assignments and projects, knowing that my sketchbook is gathering dust while my ideas keep piling up. Sometimes, I find myself doodling in the margins of my notes during lectures, just to keep that spark alive.</p>
        <p> I know that this phase is temporary, and once I find my rhythm, I’ll be able to carve out some time for my passion again. Still, I can't help but feel a bit disconnected from the joy of creating. Art was my escape, my way of expressing myself, and I’m determined to reconnect with that part of me. Maybe I can set aside just a few minutes each day to sketch, even if it’s just for fun. After all, every little bit helps keep the creative flame burning, right?</p>

        <p>My desire to be creative has led me to pick up this HTML course as an elective. And so far, I’m really liking it! Yes, it’s hard work, but it really feels rewarding when I see the results of my efforts at the end. I think that this is a great way to merge my artistic interests with my degree.</p>
        <p>Creating websites feels like a fresh canvas where I can combine design and functionality. I enjoy playing around with layouts, colors, and typography, always considering how to make the user experience both visually appealing and intuitive. It’s exciting to realize that coding can be a form of art, allowing me to express my creativity in a new way</p>
